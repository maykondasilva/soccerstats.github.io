-**Table 1** shows the country of origin, goals, assists of the 5 most valuable players by their position in the 2018/2019 season. The value of forwards is numerically higher than the value of midfielders, goakeepers or defenders. As a matter of fact, our visualization suggests the presence of an association between the player's value and the number of goals.

-**Figure 1** shows the 5 players with the highest value in the top 5 European leagues in an interactive visualization. A large proportion of these players were strikers and showed a high number of goals and assists during the analyzed season.
