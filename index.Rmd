Soccer is one of the most popular sports around the world. European soccer leagues are specially well known due to their history, quality and number of fans that watch their matches. Our main objective was to explore who are the most valuable players and the top scorers in the top 5 European leagues. Specifically we were interested in answering the following questions:

***

**-1 Who are the top 5 most valuable soccer players, what is their nationality, position, team (squad), and how many goals did they score in the 2018/2019 season?**

***

**-2 What are the soccer teams (squad) and leagues for which the top scorers played?**

***
