PUBH 7462 - Advanced Programming and Data Analysis in R

Final Project Proposal 

Felipe Pena Mosca and Maykon da Silva
 
 

**1. The tentative project title:**
  
The Best Performing Soccer Players in the Top 5 European Leagues: Goals, Assists, Cards, Most Valuable Players, and More

 
**2. The motivation for this project:**
 
Both of us really like soccer and soccer is the most popular sport worldwide. For our final project, we wanted to work on something we enjoy learning about/working on and something that could potentially be of interest to other people as well. We want to create a website that displays soccer stats in a fun, interactive way (with tables, graphs, figures, and maybe maps), which is not how soccer stats are available in most cases.
 
**3. The question(s) of interest (minimum 1 per group member):**
 
**3.1** Who are the top 5 most valuable soccer players, what is their nationality, position, team (squad), and how many goals did they score in the 2018/2019 season?
 
**3.2** What are the soccer teams (squad) and leagues for which the top scorers played?
 
**3.3** What are the top 10 nationalities with the highest number of goals scored by their top 5 scorers? 
 
**4. The anticipated data sources:**
 
The data set we will be working on was downloaded from Kaggle.com and includes soccer players’ values and their statistics. This data set was merged from transfermarket.de and fbref.com for the 2018/2019 season. It has 400 columns/variables and 2100 rows/observations so a lot to explore. 
 
**5. Initial ideas regarding the analyses plan & final product(s): e.g. flexdashboard, plotlty, leaflet, shiny, etc.**
 
We plan to create a website with GitHub where any soccer lovers can find statistics related to soccer players, teams, nationalities, etc. for the top 5 European leagues (English league, Spanish League, Italian League, German League, French League). We will include a dashboard with graphs that display the most important information that soccer fans would like to check out. We plan to use plotly, leaflet and even ggmap to include interactive figures/graphs and maps including players’ nationality and soccer teams’ country of origin. 
 
**6. Planned contributions for each team member (i.e. what is each group member responsible for in this project).**
 
Maykon da Silva: Maykon will be responsible for the first question (3.1). In addition, Maykon will be responsible for creating the website (yml, about, etc files), and the flexdashboard. 
 
Felipe Pena Mosca: Felipe will be responsible for the second and third questions (3.2 and 3.3). In addition, Felipe will be responsible for data wrangling, and data cleaning.
 
Even though we have this division of work, we will double-check with each other how things are coming along and make sure that none of us are overwhelmed with our own part of the project. It is important that we both are on top of what needs to be done and how it has been done in all aspects of the project.
