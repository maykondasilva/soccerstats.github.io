Since goals have a great impact on player's value, we decided that would be interesting to further investigate in which teams / leagues this players were playing in the 2018/2019 season. **Table 2** and **Figure 2**, identified where the top 20 scorers played in the last season (Premier League = 6, La Liga = 5 , Serie A = 3, Ligue 1 = 3, Bundesliga = 2)
